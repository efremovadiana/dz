    How much luggage can you carry on? 
    You can carry one small bag and one medium bag, for a total of two bags. 
    You may not carry on three bags by insisting to airport personnel that 
    one of your bags is not really a bag, as if it is some kind of magical 
    invisible fairy bag that airline personnel cannot see. You also may not 
    carry on a suitcase the size of a sleeper sofa, apparently containing the 
    entire wardrobe of some Broadway production.

    Prohibited objects? You may not take knives, 
    guns spears, armored personnel carrier, flame-throwers, 
    scary animals or sharp objects. If you know karate or kung fu, 
    you may take your hands on board, but you must keep them clasped tightly 
    under you armpits throughout the flight.
